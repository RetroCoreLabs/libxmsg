** This end GENERATES the transmit clock: the SPI2 peripheral runs as a  **
** master, clock out on PIN_TX_CLOCK, data out on PIN_TX_DATA. Bytes to  **
** send are taken from g_tx_buffer; when it is empty the line is kept at **
** HDLC_IDLE (all ones, marking). The receive half, which follows the    **
** far end's clock, is spi_rx_task.                                      **
