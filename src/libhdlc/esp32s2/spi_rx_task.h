/**************************************************************************
** SPI_RX_TASK - receive half of the synchronous line                    **
**                                                                       **
** The FAR END supplies the receive clock. The SPI3 peripheral runs as a **
** slave following that clock, with DMA filling a ring of buffers; this  **
** task copies the filled buffers into g_rx_buffer for the HDLC decoder. **
**                                                                       **
** The stock ESP-IDF slave driver cannot do this: it works in            **
** transactions that start when software queues one and end when chip   **
** select rises, and an HDLC line has no chip select. So this file       **
** programs the peripheral through the low-level register layer          **
** (hal/spi_ll.h) instead. See spi_rx_task.c for the register facts      **
** and the reference manual sections they come from.                     **
**                                                                       **
** STATUS: verified on the bench 2026-11-08 with GPIO 7 wired to GPIO 12 **
** and GPIO 11 to GPIO 9 on the same board: 24 of 24 frames received     **
** with a good FCS at 9600, 38400 and 983000 bit/s, no FIFO overruns,    **
** no DMA errors. Repeat: open the debug console, type HDLC then F, and  **
** expect "HDLC frame, 24 bytes, FCS good".                              **
**                                                                       **
