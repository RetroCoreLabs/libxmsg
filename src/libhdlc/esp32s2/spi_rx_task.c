** SPI_RX_TASK - receive half of the synchronous line                    **
**                                                                       **
** Pins (any GPIO works, the signals go through the GPIO matrix):         **
**   PIN_RX_CLOCK GPIO 12 <- receive clock from the far end               **
**   PIN_RX_DATA  GPIO 9  <- RD, the data we receive                      **
** No chip-select pin. The slave's CS input is driven from inside the    **
** GPIO matrix: ESP32-S2 TRM 5.2.3 (page 169) - selecting input 0x38     **
** gives a constant 1, 0x3C a constant 0. CS starts at 1 (deselected)    **
** and is switched to 0 once everything is armed; that switch is the     **
** falling edge the slave wants.                                         **
**                                                                       **
** Register facts this file relies on (ESP32-S2 TRM, Version 1.3):       **
**  - 24.5 (p.591): in slave mode "The CS signal should be held low      **
**    during the transmission, and its falling/rising edges indicate the **
**    start/end of a transmission."                                      **
**  - 24.5.4 and 24.8 (p.596, 600): DMA full-duplex segmented-transfer   **
**    mode (SPI_DMA_SLV_SEG_TRANS_EN) keeps receiving as long as CS is   **
**    low; with SPI_RX_EOF_EN = 0 no end-of-frame is ever generated, so  **
**    the DMA just walks the descriptor chain.                           **
**  - 24.9 (p.601): slave input clock up to f_apb/2 = 40 MHz.            **
**  - 24.11.2 (p.608): SPI_INFIFO_FULL_ERR_INT = DMA RX FIFO full while  **
**    data still arrives, i.e. we lost bytes.                            **
** ESP-IDF v5.5.5 facts (esp32s2 hal/spi_ll.h):                          **
**  - spi_ll_slave_set_rx_bitlen() and spi_ll_dma_rx_enable() are empty  **
**    on the S2 ("not used in esp32s2"); the length is not programmed.   **
**  - the DMA engine's descriptor is the ROM lldesc_t; a descriptor is   **
**    4-byte aligned, buffer size a multiple of 4, owner bit 1 = DMA.    **
**  - spi_dma_ll_rx_start() writes dma_in_link.addr (20 bits) and start. **
**                                                                       **
** Two things the manual does not state for slave mode were confirmed on **
** the bench 2026-11-08 (loopback from spi_tx_task on the same board,    **
** 24 of 24 frames good at 9600, 38400 and 983000 bit/s): the DMA hands  **
** descriptors back (owner -> software) one by one while the transfer    **
** stays open, and the matrix switch of CS from 0x38 to 0x3C counts as   **
** the falling edge the slave needs. Pins: datasheet v1.9 Table 2-3 puts **
** SPI3 on no IO MUX pin at all, so SPI3 always goes through the matrix. **
**                                                                       **
